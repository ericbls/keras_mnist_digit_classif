# keras_mnist_digit_class
**Author: Eric Buonpater Lee Santos**
**Default Idiom: Portuguese**

This is a convolutional neural network application for classification of manuscript numeric digits (0 to 9). It imports a well-known database called MNIST, already included in the package KERAS. The MNIST database includes several 28 pixels images of hand-written single digits.
In the main code, these images are used to train neural networks to recognize and classify new images and tell which number from 0 to 9 each represents.
